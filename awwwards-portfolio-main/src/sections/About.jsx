When I'm not analyzing:

⚡️ Exploring new datasets (or digging into yours)

📊 Sharing insights & tips on LinkedIn—because data literacy helps everyone

🧩 Solving puzzles & brain teasers (pattern-finding, real-world edition)

🎧 Listening to podcasts while dashboards refresh (multitasking at its finest)`;
